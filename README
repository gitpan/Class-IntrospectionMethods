This package provides Class::IntrospectionMethods.  A module to create
method with introspection feature. In other words, this module provides:

- A way to set up a lot of get/set method. These get/set methods can
  access plain scalars, array, hash. These scalar, hash or array can
  be tied (See perltie) with classes specified by the user. The
  element of these arrays or hashes can be constrained to be object,
  tied scalar.

- A way to later query the object or class to retrieve the list of
  methods (aka slots) created by this module.

- A way to organize these slots in several catalogs.

- A way to backtrack from contained object to container object: When a
  slot contains object or tied scalars hashes or arrays, the contained
  object can be queried for the container object. In other words, the
  parent object (the one constructed by Class::IntrospectionMethods
  contains a child object in one of its slots either as a plain object
  or an object hidden behind a tied
  construct. Class::IntrospectionMethods will provide the child object
  a method to retrieve the parent object reference.

This module was forked from a modified version of Class::MethodMaker
v1.08. To ease migration from older project using Class::MethodMaker
to Class::IntrospectionMethods, a compatiblity mode is provided
(although some features of Class::MethodMaker will not work. See 
Class::IntrospectionMethods::Legacy man page).

To Martyn J. Pearce for Class::MethodMaker and the enlightening
discussion we had a while ago about parent and catalog.

To Matthew Simon Cavalletto for the parameter translation idea that I
pilfered from Class::MakeMethods.
